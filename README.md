# nox

my attempt at a version of JARVIS. Just something to tinker on in my free time using tools I find online, languages I had an idea in or something I wanted to learn better.

The Typescript / JavaScript version has many different modules built out but hasn't been connected in a way that's feasible for consistent use.

See individual folders for information on installing and running each version of **nox**.
