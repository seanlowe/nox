# nox

my attempt at a version of JARVIS. Just something to tinker on in my free time using tools I find online, languages I had an idea in or something I wanted to learn better.

To build **nox** in it's current state:
```
npm run build
```

Then to run it, from typescript directory:
```
node lib/index.js [options]
```
