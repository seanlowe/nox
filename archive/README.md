# Archive

This folder holds remnants of older, outdated and poorly written typescript modules that I'm keeping around for posterity and for inspiration should I need it / want to rewrite any of these in the new project. These files do not run as any ENV values have been deleted and the directory stucture flattened without updating the files affected.

You can think of this folder as a "trash but could be helpful later" pile.
