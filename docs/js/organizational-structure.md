## Organizational Structure for JS Components and Logic

Since `nox` is a fullstack application with a completely separate frontend and backend, directory structure will be split up accordingly.

As mentioned in the overarching design docs, the frontend application is built off of Next.js and follows the starter directory structure that is generated when running `npx create-next-app`.

```
src/
├── components/
│   ├── data/
│   ├── layouts/
│   ├── modules/
│   └── layout.js
├── extensions/
│   ├── components/
│   │   ├── data/
│   │   └── modules/
│   └── prisma/
├── pages/
├── public/
│   └── images/
├── services/
├── styles/
├── utilities/
│   ├── contexts/
│   ├── hooks/
│   ├── instances/
│   └── reducers/
└── next.config.js
```

Breaking down the above graph:

### `/components`
<details>
  <summary> Expand </summary>
  This is the top level directory that holds layout and rendering components and/or data required by them.

  #### `/components/data/`
  > The idea behind this directory is to store initial data for rendering components or for storing placeholder data. If storing data generated by the application, that information should go into `../storage/` where it can be nested into a folder specific to that module or into the general `../storage/logs` directory.

  #### `/components/layouts/`
  > For purely layout related components, there exists a directory `/components/layouts/` in which to store them. A current example of this is the Banner component. The Banner component is used for exactly that, the headliner that displays the nox status graphic and name on all pages. Another example could components that are key functionality, such as a sidebar, nav, or main content section.

  #### `/components/modules/`
  > This is where components for specific functionality (weather, meal planning, etc) live. Each module should have it's own directory and be, more or less, self contained.
  >
  > See the [Modules](../design-notes.md#modules) section of the overarching design docs for more specific information on modules.
</details>
<br></br>

<!-- ### `/extensions`
<details>
  <summary> Expand </summary>
  The extensions directory is an clear place to add user-files for extending the functionality of nox.

  #### `extensions/components/`
  > This directory mirrors the `/components` directory in that there are two subdirectories, `data/` and `modules/`, in which you can add homebrew extensions.

  #### `extensions/prisma/`
  > This is where components for specific functionality (weather, meal planning, etc) live. Each module should have it's own directory and be, more or less, self contained.
</details>

<br></br> -->

### `/pages`
<details>
  <summary> Expand </summary>
  Next.js /pages directory. Every file here becomes a route. See Next.js's documentation on [Pages](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages) for more information.

</details>

<br></br>

### `/public`
<details>
  <summary> Expand </summary>
  Next.js's static assets directory. When using <img ..> or next/image, you can directly use images here. See Next.js's documentation on [static file serving](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/static-file-serving).

</details>

<br></br>

### `/services`
<details>
  <summary> Expand </summary>
  The directory in which module logic not directly related to rendering lives. For example, if there exists a function to retrieve information from the database, that function would live in a file here and would be called from the component.

</details>

<br></br>

### `/styles`
<details>
  <summary> Expand </summary>
  A singular directory that style (SCSS) files can be placed into. These are imported individually into `/styles/global.scss` which is, in turn, directly imported into `/pages/_app.js`.

</details>

<br></br>

### `/utilities`
<details>
  <summary> Expand </summary>

  #### `/utilities/contexts/`
  > For contexts. Contexts should be single-purpose and minimal in size so as to not make things confusing on what a context handles.

  #### `/utilities/hooks/`
  > Custom hooks live here.

  #### `/utilities/instances/`
  > For any import or library who's usage entails creating an instance of something or for managing a single connections across multiple files, those files should go here. 
  > 
  > **Example:** creating and exporting an axios instance with the url prefix set to the host of the separate Golang backend. This allows using a singular instance of axios that shares all config options across multiple modules without having to redefine or be particularly verbose in the code.

  #### `/utilities/reducers/`
  > This is where reducers for contexts should live.
