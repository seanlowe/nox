## Commit Styling and Formatting

Example commit message:

    <tag>: <summary>

Where \<tag> could be any of the following:

| Name      | Reasoning
|-----------|-----------
| admin     | changes to packages, scripts, configuration
| assets    | changes to static asset images
| be        | changes to backend code
| db        | changes to database related files ([Prisma](./prisma-notes.md))
| docs      | changes to README or any other documentation
| ui        | changes to styling or ui changes across multiple frontend modules

Or you could put the specific module you worked on, which you can find a list of in our [Design Notes](./design-notes.md#naming-convention)
